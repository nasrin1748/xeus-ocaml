   {1 Communication Protocol}
   @author Davy Cottet
   Defines the core data structures used for communication between the C++/JavaScript
   frontend and the OCaml backend of the kernel.

   These types are automatically serialized to and from JSON using `ppx_deriving_yojson`,
   forming a strict contract between the two parts of the application. This module
   is the single source of truth for the API.
