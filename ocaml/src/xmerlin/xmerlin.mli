 This module serves as the primary bridge between the `xeus-ocaml` kernel's
 protocol and the Merlin code analysis library. It is responsible for handling
 all synchronous code intelligence requests, such as code completion, type
 inspection, and error checking.
  It operates on a virtual filesystem (VFS) that must be populated with the
 necessary Merlin artifacts (`.cmi`, `.cmt`, `.cmti`) by the {!Xlibloader}
 module before this module is initialized.

(**
  Initializes the Merlin configuration.
  This function should be called exactly once during kernel startup, immediately
  after the {!Xlibloader.setup} function has successfully completed. It finalizes
  the configuration Merlin will use to find standard library modules in the
  virtual filesystem.

val initialize : unit -> unit

(**
  Processes a synchronous, Merlin-related action from the kernel protocol.
 
  This is the main entry point for handling code intelligence requests. It takes
  a protocol action, determines if it's a command intended for Merlin, and if so,
  executes the corresponding Merlin query (e.g., `Complete_prefix`, `Type_enclosing`).
 
  @param action The {!Protocol.action} to be processed.
  @return It returns [`Some json_result`] if the action was a Merlin command and was
          processed successfully. It returns [`None`] if the action is not a Merlin
          command (e.g., `Eval`), indicating that another part of the system
          should handle it.
