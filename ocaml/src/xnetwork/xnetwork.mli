    This module provides a minimal, promise-based interface for performing
    asynchronous network requests within the browser. It abstracts the
    callback-based nature of `XmlHttpRequest` into a more convenient Lwt-based
    API for use throughout the OCaml kernel.

    Asynchronously fetches the content of a given URL.
   
    This function uses the browser's `XmlHttpRequest` API to perform a GET request.
    It is designed to be safe for fetching both text and binary content by requesting
    an `arraybuffer` and then converting it to a string.
   
    @param url The URL of the resource to fetch.
    @return A promise that resolves to [`Some string`] containing the file content
            on success (HTTP 200), or [`None`] if the fetch fails for any reason
            (e.g., a network error or a non-200 status code like 404).
