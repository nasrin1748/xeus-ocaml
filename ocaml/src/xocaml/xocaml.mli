  This module is the main entry point for the entire OCaml side of the `xeus-ocaml`
  kernel. When compiled with `js_of_ocaml`, it produces the `xocaml.js` bundle.
 
  Its primary responsibility is to expose a well-defined JavaScript API that the
  C++ part of the kernel (running as WebAssembly) can call into. This API is
  registered in the global JavaScript scope under the `xocaml` object.
 
  The exported API consists of three key functions:
 
  - `processMerlinAction(jsonString)`: A **synchronous** function for handling
    quick, non-blocking code intelligence requests (completion, inspection, etc.).
    It takes a JSON string and immediately returns a JSON string.
 
  - `processToplevelAction(jsonString, callback)`: An **asynchronous** function for
    handling potentially long-running operations like code evaluation (`Eval`) or
    the initial kernel setup (`Setup`). It takes a JSON string and a JavaScript
    callback function. It returns immediately, and the result (as a JSON string)
    is delivered later by invoking the provided callback.
 
  - `mountFS()`: A function to trigger the mounting of the Emscripten virtual
    filesystem device from within OCaml.
 
  This module orchestrates the initialization sequence and delegates incoming
  requests to the appropriate sub-modules (`Xmerlin`, `Xtoplevel`, `Xlibloader`).
