   Provides a bridge between the OCaml standard library's file operations and
   the Emscripten Filesystem (FS) API. This allows standard OCaml code using
   modules like `Sys`, `In_channel`, and `Out_channel` to operate on an
   in-memory filesystem within the browser.
   
   The module registers a custom `js_of_ocaml` VFS (Virtual File System)
   device that translates these OCaml calls into their corresponding
   JavaScript calls on the Emscripten `FS` object. All filesystem operations
   are rooted at the `/drive/` mount point.
   Based on https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/blob/master/runtime/js/fs.js and
https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/blob/master/runtime/js/fs_fake.js *)

   Initializes the connection to the Emscripten FS and mounts it as a device
   at `/drive/` within the `js_of_ocaml` VFS.
   
   This is the primary setup function for all filesystem functionality in the
   kernel and must be called once at startup before any file I/O is attempted.
   
   Internally, this function performs the following steps:
   1. Lazily finds and caches the global `Module.FS` object provided by the
      Emscripten runtime.
   2. Constructs a JavaScript "device" object that maps OCaml VFS operations
      (e.g., `exists`, `readdir`, `open`) to the corresponding Emscripten `FS`
      methods.
   3. Pushes this device object onto the `jsoo_runtime.jsoo_mount_point`
      array, making it active.
   4. Attempts to change the current working directory of the OCaml process to
      `/drive/`.
   
   The function includes error handling and will log critical failures to the
   console if the Emscripten `FS` object cannot be found or the device fails
   to mount.
