   {1 OCaml Toplevel (REPL)}
   @author Davy Cottet

   This module implements the core Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) functionality for
   the `xeus-ocaml` kernel. It is responsible for initializing the OCaml toplevel
   environment and for executing user-provided code.

   The module relies on the `js_of_ocaml-toplevel` library for the underlying
   evaluation mechanism. It enhances this by capturing all forms of output
   (stdout, stderr, toplevel values, and rich display data from the {!Xlib}
   module) and handling special toplevel directives like `#require`.

   {b CRITICAL}: The {!setup} function in this module must only be called *after*
   the {!Xlibloader.setup} function has successfully completed to ensure the
   necessary standard library files are present in the virtual filesystem.

   Initializes the OCaml toplevel environment.

   This function performs the final steps of the kernel's OCaml-side setup. It
   must be called after the virtual filesystem has been populated by {!Xlibloader.setup}.

   Its main tasks are:
   - Initializing the `js_of_ocaml` toplevel machinery.
   - Creating the initial compiler environment, which requires `stdlib.cmi`.
   - Automatically opening the {!Xlib} module to make rich display functions
     globally available to the user.

   @param url The base URL where third-party library files are located. This is
              stored and used later when handling `#require` directives.
   @before 0.1.0 This function has significant side effects, creating and modifying
                 the global state of the OCaml toplevel environment. It should
                 only be called once at kernel startup.

val setup : url:string -> unit

(**
   Parses and evaluates a string of OCaml code.

   This is the main execution function for the kernel. It takes a block of code,
   splits it into individual toplevel phrases (ending in `;;`), and executes
   them sequentially.

   It captures all outputs generated during execution, including standard streams,
   the printed value of the last expression, and any rich outputs created via
   the {!Xlib} module. It also provides special handling for the `#require "lib_name"`
   directive by delegating to the {!Xlibloader.load_on_demand} function.

   @param code The string of OCaml code to evaluate.
   @return A promise that resolves to a list of all captured {!Protocol.output}
           items, which will be sent to the Jupyter frontend for display.
