   {1 Library and Artifact Loader}
   @author Davy Cottet

   Interface for loading OCaml library files and Merlin artifacts into the
   browser's virtual filesystem. This module is the central point for managing
   the files required for both the OCaml toplevel and the Merlin code analysis engine.

   It supports a hybrid loading strategy:
   - Statically embedding critical files at build time.
   - Dynamically fetching standard library files at kernel startup.
   - Dynamically fetching third-party libraries on-demand via `#require`.
 *)

(**
   Performs the initial file setup for the kernel environment.

   This function orchestrates the loading of all files necessary for the OCaml
   standard library to function correctly within the toplevel and Merlin. It
   first writes any statically-linked files (like `stdlib.cmi`) to the virtual
   filesystem, then asynchronously fetches all other standard library artifacts
   (`.cmt`, `.cmti`, and other `.cmi` files) from the server.

   This function must be called and awaited successfully *before* the OCaml
   toplevel or Merlin engine are initialized to prevent `Env.Error` exceptions.

   @param base_url The root URL from which to fetch the dynamic standard library files.
   @return A promise that resolves when all initial files have been loaded.

val setup : base_url:string -> unit Lwt.t

(**
   Dynamically loads a pre-compiled third-party OCaml library on-demand.

   This function is triggered by the toplevel when it encounters a `#require "lib_name"`
   directive. It looks up the library in a pre-generated manifest (`external_libs.ml`),
   then fetches the corresponding JavaScript bundle and all its Merlin artifacts
   (`.cmi`, `.cmt`, `.cmti`).

   The JavaScript bundle is executed to make the library's modules available, and
   the artifacts are written to the virtual filesystem to enable code completion
   and documentation for the new library.

   @param base_url The root URL where the library's `.js` bundle and artifact files are stored.
   @param name The name of the library to load (e.g., "ocamlgraph").
   @return A promise that resolves to a result, containing either a success message
           for display in the notebook output, or an error message if the library
           could not be found or loaded.
