    {1 Library and Artifact Loader}
    @author Davy Cottet
   
    This module is responsible for loading all necessary files into the
    `js_of_ocaml` virtual filesystem (VFS). It handles three distinct loading phases:
   
    1.  **Static Loading:** At build time, essential files (like `stdlib.cmi`)
        are embedded directly into the main kernel bundle. The {!setup}
        function writes these files to the VFS at startup.
   
    2.  **Initial Dynamic Loading:** During kernel startup, the {!setup} function
        asynchronously fetches the remaining standard library artifacts (`.cmi`,
        `.cmt`, `.cmti`) from a specified base URL and writes them to the VFS.
        This ensures Merlin has full access to the standard library for
        completion and documentation.
   
    3.  **On-Demand Dynamic Loading:** When a user issues a `#require "lib_name"`
        directive in a notebook, the {!load_on_demand} function is called. It
        fetches the pre-compiled JavaScript bundle and all associated Merlin
        artifacts for that specific library.
   
    This hybrid approach ensures a fast initial startup while providing comprehensive
    and extensible language support.

    A helper to generate the base filename for a standard library module.
    It handles the special cases for "Stdlib" and the kernel's own "Xlib",
    and follows the `dune` naming convention for submodules (e.g., `Stdlib.Mutex`
    becomes `stdlib__Mutex`).
    @param mod_name The capitalized module name (e.g., "Mutex").
    @return The base filename (e.g., "stdlib__Mutex").

    Performs the initial file setup for the kernel environment.
   
    This function orchestrates the loading of all files necessary for the OCaml
    standard library to function correctly within the toplevel and Merlin. It
    first writes any statically-linked files (like `stdlib.cmi`) to the virtual
    filesystem, then asynchronously fetches all other standard library artifacts
    (`.cmt`, `.cmti`, and other `.cmi` files) from the server.
   
    This function must be called and awaited successfully *before* the OCaml
    toplevel or Merlin engine are initialized to prevent `Env.Error` exceptions.
   
    @param base_url The root URL from which to fetch the dynamic standard library files.
    @return A promise that resolves when all initial files have been loaded.

    Dynamically loads a pre-compiled third-party OCaml library on-demand.
   
    This function is triggered by the toplevel when it encounters a `#require "lib_name"`
    directive. It looks up the library in a pre-generated manifest (`external_libs.ml`),
    then fetches the corresponding JavaScript bundle and all its Merlin artifacts
    (`.cmi`, `.cmt`, `.cmti`).
   
    The JavaScript bundle is executed to make the library's modules available, and
    the artifacts are written to the virtual filesystem to enable code completion
    and documentation for the new library.
   
    @param base_url The root URL where the library's `.js` bundle and artifact files are stored.
    @param name The name of the library to load (e.g., "ocamlgraph").
    @return A promise that resolves to a result, containing either a success message
            for display in the notebook output, or an error message if the library
            could not be found or loaded.
